## jFugue
jFugue ([jfugue.org](https://jfugue.org)) is an awesome music library for java that uses an ingenious way of playing music, called the MusicString.

This player generates a keyboard (with 15 keys, but you can change it...) and generates a .txt file and .midi file once you're done. Just click exit
